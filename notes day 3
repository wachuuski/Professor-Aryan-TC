built in libraries

math.x
math.ceil,math.floor,math.round - rounding
math.e,math.pi,math.sqrt2 - constants
math.abs, math.pow(base, power)
just search up the math library

date/time

const currentDateTime = new Date() - just outputs the system date/time
const specificDate = new Date([year], [month], [day], [hour], [minute], [second])
    requires at least year and day
    with only one input it will assume milliseconds since jan 1 1970
incrementing date will wrap around like how time works
date.getDay(), date.getMonth() - take a wild guess what these do


variables on their own should always start with lowercase
objects tend to start with capitals

random
const rand = Math.random
