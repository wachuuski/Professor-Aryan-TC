good to note: remember how to do arrays-- 
let myArray = ["red", "blue", "green", "purple"]
console.log(myArr[3]) outputs purple

objects


expressions are the same or very similar to math
single = is an assignment (setting x = y)
double == is an operator (1+2==9/3 returns true)
!= is not equals
less than <
greater than >
less equal <=
greater equal >=


conditionals
```
if (bool) {
    do something here
} else if (bool2) {
    more stuff
} else {
    final stuff
}
```
can use && or || for and/or

switch statement

```
switch (answer) {
    case "y":
    case "Y":
        console.log("Nice! That's great!");
        break;
    case "n":
    case "N":
        console.log ("Aww man");
        break;
    case "":
        console.log ("At least say something");
        break;
    default:
        console.log "Idk what that means
        break;
}
```

loops

while
```
let reply = prompt("Are we there yet?");
while (reply != "yes") {
    reply = prompt ("Are we there yet?");
}
console.log "finally, we're here!"
```

for

```
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++){
    wordArr.push(prompt("tell me word #" + i +: "));
// .push adds something to the end of the list
}
console.log(wordArr)
```
that format will run x number of times, for 'i < x'
